##Overview

Proof-of-stake consensus is a form of distrusted consensus that uses the current holders of the currency to achieve consensus on the current block chain and verify transactions.  This is in contrast to proof-of-work distributed consensus, which is what Bitcoin uses, and which relies on solving difficult computational problems to verify the validity of transactions.  There are currently main issues of whether a pure or mixed proof-of-stake consensus algorithm can work in the real world as attacks on the security of the system appear to be easy to make.  


#### Vocabulary

**POS**: Proof-of-stake - abbreviation

**POW**: Proof-of-work - abbreviation - what Bitcoin uses to achieve distributed consensus, frequently compared against Proof-of-stake systems.
