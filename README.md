# Bitcoin Knowledge Systemizaiton

The primary goal of this repository is to simplify the process of learning the state-of-the-art with regards to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. A first goal is providing links to all knowledge, and sorting the links by category. A second goal is summarizing each category and curating the links so that the most relevent information is easily accessible and noiser or redundant information sources are separated or pruned. A third goal is making sure that there is fluid and easy direction when learning - categories should comfortably link to prerequisite or related categories.

A single link or discussion may be relevant to multiple categories. When this is the case, the link should appear in all categories.

This repository is a work in progress. Some categories, such as 'Transaction Fees' should clearly be split into multiple categories, but not enough content has been curated yet to justify the split. Many obvious categories, such as snarks, are missing altogether. If there is something missing that you feel strongly about, please pitch in and make a pull request.

Any high-signal content will be merged, especially during the early days of the repository. Every week at 8pm EST, a group of people get together to work for a few hours on the repository.

### High Signal vs. Low Signal Links

A high signal link contains content that is largely up-to-date and state-of-the-art, concise, and directly relevant to the category where the link is listed.

A low signal link may contain content that is not fully up to date, may contain inaccurate content, or may contain large volumes of content that are not directly relevant to the category where the link is listed.

Links are approximately sorted by signal strength.
