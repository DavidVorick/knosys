## Overview

A prediction market enables the trading of uncertain future outcomes. An
example prediction market offers the question "Will Hillary Clinton win the
2016 US Presidential election?". The possible answers are 'yes' and 'no', and
everyone who owns shares of the winning answer will receive $1. Shares can be
traded, and the price of each share indicates the probability of that result
becoming true. 'Yes' trading for 65% indicates that Hillary Clinton, as
perceived by the market, has a 65% chance of winning the election. In a
sufficiently liquid market, 'No' will trade for 35%.

A decentralized prediction market is a prediction market that is not controlled
by a centralized party, and generally pursues features such as censorship
resistance, manipulation resistance, and privacy for the participants in the
system.

The most notable existing decentralized predicion markets are Truthcoin and
Augur. Each has a significant amount of criticism and skepticism stacked
against it, though mostly only existing in an informal context.

#### Vocabulary

**Arbiter**: A fallible entity that must be trusted to provide correct
information about the physical world.

**Oracle**: While often referring to something that can provide any information
as an act of God, within the context of prediction markets 'Oracle' typically
refers to an entity that can accurately provide information about the physical
world.

**Trust Agility**: Trusting a central authority, but with the ability to choose
a different trusted authority on short notice, with little risk, and with
little cost.
